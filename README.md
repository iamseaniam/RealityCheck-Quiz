<h1>Reality Check:</h1>
A quiz on different instances of the infamous Mandela effect. Can you be fooled by the Mandela effect? Or are you in touch with reality?

For our project, we created a quiz which tests the user's knowledge on 5 Mandela effects utilizing HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. The webpage will prompt the user to start the quiz, then complete the quiz by clicking the images that they think are the correct answers. Our script tracks their score along the way and gives a final score at the end.

<b>Instructions for use:</b>
1. Open link: http://cnidesigns.com/Atlas/reality.html
2. Upon opening, only title and Start button reveal initially. Quiz questions are hidden until Start is clicked.
3. Click "Start" button
4. Questions reveal themselves, each question containing 2 possible answer options in the form of image buttons. The user should click on whichever answer they believe to be correct.
5. After an answer is selected, the button the user clicked will be assigned either a red border or a green border:
   - <i>red</i> = incorrect
   - <i>green</i> = correct
   - The score updates at the bottom with each correct answer.
7. User continues clicking on answer options under each question prompt until all 5 questions are answered.
8. Final score is tallied at the bottom.

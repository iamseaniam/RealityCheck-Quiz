Reality Check: A quiz on different instances of the infamous Mandela effect. Can you be fooled by the Mandela effect? Or are you in touch with reality?

The quiz prompts the user with questions, each question containing 2 possible answers. The user should select whichever answer they believe to be correct. The answer choices are images that act as buttons, so once an option is selected, the correct answer is revealed in the form of a third picture, which is hidden until an answer is selected.
